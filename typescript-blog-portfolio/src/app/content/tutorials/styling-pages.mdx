### Layout

1. Alignent is key

- Left Alignment is most natural
- many types, top, bottom, center, left, right

### The Grid

- Way of orgnaizing on page for recognisable structure
- Better in equal sizes,
- Reuse same values as much as possible
- Gives audience a sense of clarity
- Should be flexible
- Helps design process at the beginning
- Most design rules can be broken, although must be done with intention

### Figma

- Hero Section
  #### Grid
        - Select Frame (will be using desktop)
        - Good to use 12 column grids, can be slpit into 6's 4's 3's and 2's
        - Grid is an overlay

#### Visual Heirarchy

- One thing should grab your attention on a page
- Should even be a visual heirarchy between two buttons if you have a main one
- Small fraction of what we see is a high definition
- **BOLD** text can make it stand out on a page
- Primary and secondary buttons can be used very well
- Beware of Optical Illusions, somethigns looks diffferent sizes but look the same
- Proximity is important, related things should be close together

#### Typography

- Styles, bold, regular, contect, compatibality
- Some sites like google are basically just text
- Typeface and font are different things, Helvetica is a typeface, Helvetical Bold is a font
- Proxima Soft would be a good font for my website, soft and approaching

### Typeface Categories

- Serif(usually have small tails) vs Sans Serif
- Styles
  - Old Styles, classical, businesses like law firms
  - Mordern, similar to classicals, usually used for luxury and professional stuff, usually reserved for headlines
  - Slab, suitable for mechanical and string things
  - Sans Serif, most versatile
  - Display, unforgiving personalities, shouldnt be used for paragraphs
  - Script, not to be used for paragraphs

### Setting Type

- panorama settings(wide spaced), makes font stand out more
- Changing spacing and line height can make text much easier to read
- Font Weights

## Use Maximum 2 fonts for each project, Make sure they're different

### Where to find fonts

- da fonts (for free fonts, although free fonts should be avoided)
- Paid fonts are usually superior and less likely to be overused
- subscription fonts, such as adobe fonts
- google fonts is probably the best option, also built in to figma and webflow
- check out ofnt ninja to find out font that a website is using
