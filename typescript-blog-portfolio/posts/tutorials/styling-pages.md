1. Alignent is key
-   Left Alignment is most natural
- many types, top, bottom, center, left, right

### The Grid
 - Way of orgnaizing on page for recognisable structure
 - Better in equal sizes,
 - Reuse same values as much as possible
 - Gives audience a sense of clarity
 - Should be flexible
 - Helps design process at the beginning
 - Most design rules can be broken, although must be done with intention
