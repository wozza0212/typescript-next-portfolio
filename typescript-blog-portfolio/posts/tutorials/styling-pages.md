1. Alignent is key
-   Left Alignment is most natural
- many types, top, bottom, center, left, right

### The Grid
 - Way of orgnaizing on page for recognisable structure
 - Better in equal sizes,
 - Reuse same values as much as possible
 - Gives audience a sense of clarity
 - Should be flexible
 - Helps design process at the beginning
 - Most design rules can be broken, although must be done with intention

#### Visual Heirarchy
- One thing should grab your attention on a page
- Should even be a visual heirarchy between two buttons if you have a main one
- Small fraction of what we see is a high definition
- __BOLD__ text can make it stand out on a page
- Primary and secondary buttons can be used very well
- Beware of Optical Illusions, somethigns looks diffferent sizes but look the same
- Proximity is important, related things should be close together
